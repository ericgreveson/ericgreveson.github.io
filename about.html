      About Greveson Consulting</h1>
    <p>
      Greveson Consulting was established in 2010 to provide top-quality, innovative software
      solutions. We aim to make software that is easy to use, good to look at, and great
      value for money. We use up-to-date, agile development techniques to ensure that
      our customers get the right solution on time.</p>
    <p>
      Eric Greveson studied Engineering at Cambridge, graduating with a 1<sup>st</sup> class BA followed
      by an MEng with distinction in 2006. He then spent almost 4 years working for the 
      <a href="http://www.omg3d.com">OMG group</a> of companies as a software developer, starting at 
      <a href="http://www.yottadcl.com/">Yotta DCL</a> before moving to <a href="http://www.2d3.com">2d3</a>
      in 2009. Having had an interest in computer programming since writing his first game while at school,
      he&#39;s always on the lookout for exciting engineering and software projects to work on.</p>
    <p>
      Eric has spent many years writing programs in C++, C#, Actionscript (Flash/Flex/AIR), Python and
      other languages. He has worked with many types of database (Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL, PostgreSQL,
      SQLite, plus some cloud-based datastores) and has plenty of experience with various software libraries 
      (Qt, Boost, OpenGL, DirectShow, and many more). He enjoys writing desktop and web applications,
      interfacing with hardware devices, developing graphics, vision, and video processing algorithms,
      and likes a challenge in other areas of engineering too (control systems, robotics, electronics,
      structures and other mathematical modelling problems).</p>
    <p>
      Greveson Consulting is based in Edinburgh, UK.
